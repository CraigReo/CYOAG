            <h2>Warning! Dangerous moving parts!</h2>
            <p>You return to the bridge to find the captain holding his head<br>in his hands.  He seems very worried about what’s going on<br>
			as there is no coastguard who can reach the ship for several hours<br>if something goes wrong.  You share the engineer’s response<br>
			with him and he, too, seems disgruntled.  The captain says, “If I<br>were you I’d give him some space and investigate the staff<br>
			quarters instead.  One of the staff must be behind this and you’ll<br>definitely find some sort of clue in there!”</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<p>The captain seems disappointed in you.<br>Best not let him down again!</p>
