            <h2>The man is walking quicker now.  Still with metal loudly clinking in his bag.</h2>
            <p>You make the wise choice to follow the man.  He leads you around many corners and down<br>multiple levels of the ship before finally entering 
			into the kitchen.  You sneak into the<br>dining hall before to sneakily have a look over the serving counter to see what’s going on.<br>The entire 
			kitchen staff are being handed small, illegal knives by the man you followed.<br>He is praised by the head chef and they begin talking and laughing.
			Moving closer for<br>a better listen at what’s going on, it becomes clear that the kitchen staff are<br>all in on a plot to sink the ship.  They’re even 
			laughing about it.</p>
