            <h2>The crew's unofficial smoking shelter</h2>
            <p>After the man turns around the corner, you make a dash for the door, swinging it open and you<br>slide across the deck in a bid to catch the 
			knife before it falls off the side!<br>You slide right the way to the railing before you finally clamp it with the tips of your fingers.<br>  
			Itâ€™s a switch blade.  You stand up and as you turn around toward the door you see the same man<br>running at you.  He pushes your chest with all 
			his force, and you are sent rolling<br>over the rail into the sea.  There is no one to call for help.  You are left<br>at sea, miles from any land or 
			anything which might aid you in surviving.</p>
