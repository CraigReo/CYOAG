            <p>You approach the man and ask him if he has noticed anything suspicious<br>onboard the ship since it left port almost a week ago.  He almost<br>
			jumps at you with relief!  “Yes!  Yes, I have!” he says.  You ask him to<br>expand on what he has seen.  His voice softens as to make sure he<br>
			isn’t overheard, “The man over there works in the kitchen crew.  But he<br>has been standing over there sharpening knives all day.  He didn’t<br>
			even go to his shift earlier and nobody came looking for him.  That never<br>happens! Why would he do that? The other man carrying the knife sharpener<br>
			has not noticed your conversation.  He picks up a bag of clinking metal and<br>heads out of the room, deeper into the ship.  You thank the man who<br>
			has pointed him out to you and quietly follow the<br>clinking metal sounds down the corridor.</p>
