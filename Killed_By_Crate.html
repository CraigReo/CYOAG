            <h2>Treasure Crates</h2>
            <p>You boot the door open and it swings and hits the head chef in the head.<br>Unfortunately, he is in there with Big Petey, the 7-foot-tall rugby<br> 
			feller onboard the ship.  Big Petey runs at you and squishes you into the<br>wall.  He picks you up by the foot and swings you into a massive wooden<br>
			crate.  The crate smashes and you see that it is full of golden bars.  There<br>must be millions of pounds worth of gold in this crate alone.  Sadly,<br>
			that crate was holding up three more crates beside it.  Which without that<br>support, timbered over and came crashing down onto you.</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<p> You managed to find out what is going on, but sadly nobody will ever know after<br>
			the ship sinks and the kitchen crew escape with the secret cargo.<br>Better luck next time!</p>
