            <h2>We'll get them next time.</h2>
            <p>Just before the captain gets to the radio though,<br>the door swings open and a bunch of kitchen crew run<br>in with knives.  
			Behind them follows Big Petey!  He’s<br>the muscley giant who works on the ship.<br>Big Petey runs at you and picks you up by the collar.<br>
			You’re hanging there like a cat being held by the scruff.<br>One of the kitchen crew smash the window at the<br>front of the bridge and 
			the glass falls 30ft<br>into the crashing waves of the ocean.  Big Petey<br>throws both you and the captain out of the smashed<br>window and 
			you are left at sea.</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<p> You managed to find out what is going on, but sadly nobody will ever know.<br>Better luck next time!<br><br></p>
