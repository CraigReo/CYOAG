            <h2>The mess hall is empty.  But you can still see over the serving<br>counter into the kitchen.</h2>
            <p>You continue to listen to what’s being said.  It has become clear<br>the head chef is the only person who knows about a ‘secret place’<br>
			on the ship.  He tells the rest of the kitchen crew that he will return<br>shortly after he has checked on everything.  You follow him after<br>
			he leaves the room.  He heads toward the bow of the ship where he<br>approaches a door you’ve never seen before.  The door has a fingerprint<br>
			scanner securing it shut.  The head chef takes out a handkerchief from<br>his pocket and unfolds a human finger.  He holds it to the scanner<br>
			and the door opens, granting him entry to the room.</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<p>The hinges on the door don’t look too sturdy.<br>You could probably kick it down.<br>
			Or you could revisit the captain and ask what’s in there.<br>What do you do?</p>
